# Parallax-Effect-
In this I used html and css to create a parallax effect in a website.
This effect makes the elements of a page move at different speeds - creating a 3D depth effect.
* I used the parallax scrolling effect with the help of CSS.
* The forground and background image moves at different speeds while scrolling.
